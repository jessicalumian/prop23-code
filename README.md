# Proposition 23 Data Challenge
This is a repository of existing code for a variety of data analyses for the [CA Election Data Challenge](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/ca-election-2020-data-challenge/). It will be used as a reference as we create data visualizations relating to Prop 23. The final visualization will be done in a separate repository that will be linked on this page when it is prepared.
